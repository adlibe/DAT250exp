For this assignment I chose Svelte as my framework as that's what was used in the lecture, and I found it to be quite 
simple to learn. I also had way fewer problems in this assignment than the last assignment.

The only things I had problems with was getting the polls to be correctly created (according
to my vision), but after just trying several different methods I finally got it to work.
Another thing is that since I didn't manage to make the voting work for the API last week,
I couldn't integrate the voting part of my Poll app between the frontend and backend, however
I managed to integrate everything else and make it work. 

So the only pending issues I still have that I did not manage to solve is kind of the same
as last week + a little more. That being that I still can't vote on the API, and therefore
I couldn't integrate the voting part between the frontend and backend.

Overall I am really happy with the way my frontend has turned out, and found this assignment
to be fun and educational.

I didn't quite understand what code you wanted linked, but here is the link to 
both the frontend and backend part of my project:

backend: https://github.com/adlibe/DAT250exp/tree/main/backend 
frontend: https://github.com/adlibe/DAT250exp/tree/main/frontend
